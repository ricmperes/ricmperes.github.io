Hi! I'm Ricardo, a PostDoc researcher at the University of Zurich interested in (astro)particle physics, dark matter, developing software with Python and data analysis. I'm part of the [astroparticle group of Prof. Laura Baudis](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/baudis.html), the [XENON](https://xenonexperiment.org/) and [DARWIN](https://darwin.physik.uzh.ch/) collaborations.

My main topics of research are Multi-Messenger astrophysics with XENONnT, simulating electric fields and explorign novel photsensor solutions for the next generation of dark matter detectors. Check out my [research](/research/) page for more details!
