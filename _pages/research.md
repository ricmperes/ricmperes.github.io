COMING SOON!

My doctoral thesis can be found [here](https://ricmperes.github.io/files/RP_dissertation_27062023_compressed.pdf). It covers my work on the XENON and DARWIN dark matter projects concerning multi-messenger astrophysics, direct dark matter search, 3D electric field simulations, photosensor R&D for DARWIN and the SiPM top array of Xenoscope.
