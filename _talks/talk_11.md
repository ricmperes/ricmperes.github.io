Starting from the stability of the Standard Model and the Beta Decay spectrum solution of Pauli, the seminar will lead you into the unresolved mystery of Majorana concept of particle and the Majorana Neutrinos, their importance in rare events as Double Beta Decay without the emission of Dirac Neutrinos and various current day experiments and projects looking for this decay.
