30 min seminar on my work running full 3d electrostatic field simulations of the XENONnT detector. The seminar covered an introduction to the XENON detectors and direct DM search, the Boundary Element Method applied to electrostatic field simulations, the implemented geometry of the XENONnT TPC and current results on drift and extraction fields.
